            <p>Banasthali Vidyapith has been conceptualized to materialize the ethos of nation-building and Indian Culture. Banasthali's whole architecture stands upon the twin foundation pillars of Nationalism and Indian Culture. Since its inception, Banasthali Vidyapith has had  a clear  perspective about  its educational efforts and  has possessed a  vivid picture of the  form and pattern of educational programme  to be adopted.</p>
            <p>The architects of the Vidyapith  believed that an educational programme should be able to promote the development of a balanced and harmonious personality of the students. Hence, the educational programme of the Vidyapith was distinct from the form of education prevalent at that time which emphasized book learning to utter neglect of all other aspects of education.  Banasthali Vidyapithâ€™s aim of a full and balanced development of students' personality got concrete expression in the form of 'Panchmukhi Shiksha' which evolved out of initial experimentation. </p>
